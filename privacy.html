      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;">
        This Privacy Policy explains how NewsFlash Hub (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects,
        uses and protects information when you visit
        <strong>https://newsflashhub.netlify.app/</strong>.
        By using this website, you agree to the terms of this policy.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
      <p>
        We do not require you to create an account or submit personal information
        to read the news on this website. However, certain limited information may
        be collected automatically:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:18px;">
        <li>IP address and approximate location</li>
        <li>Browser type, operating system and device information</li>
        <li>Pages visited, time spent, and interaction events</li>
        <li>Referring website or source (if any)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is typically collected through analytics tools and server
        logs and is used in an aggregated form to understand how the site is used.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Cookies & similar technologies</h3>
      <p>
        We may use cookies or similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:18px;">
        <li>Remember basic preferences (such as language or theme)</li>
        <li>Measure traffic and usage patterns</li>
        <li>Support advertising or affiliate links if enabled in the future</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can control or delete cookies in your browser settings. If you disable
        cookies, some features may not work as intended but basic reading of
        headlines should still be possible.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services such as:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:18px;">
        <li><strong>Analytics tools</strong> (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand site usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising networks</strong> (e.g., Google AdSense) to display ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliate programs</strong> to earn commission from recommended products or services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These third parties may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to
        collect information about your use of this website and other websites. Their
        use of data is governed by their own privacy policies.

      <h3>4. Links to other websites</h3>
      <p>
        NewsFlash Hub displays headlines and links from external news publishers and
        other websites. We have no control over the content or privacy practices of
        those third-party sites. When you click a headline or link, you are subject
        to that website’s policies, not ours.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Data retention</h3>
      <p>
        Usage data collected for analytics is typically stored in aggregated form
        and does not personally identify individual users. Retention periods are
        determined by the respective analytics or advertising providers.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Children’s privacy</h3>

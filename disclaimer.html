      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;">
        The information provided on <strong>NewsFlash Hub</strong>
        (<strong>https://newsflashhub.netlify.app/</strong>) is for general
        information and news-discovery purposes only. While we try to display
        relevant and timely headlines, we make no guarantees regarding the
        accuracy, completeness or reliability of any information shown.
      </p>

      <h3>News &amp; article content</h3>
      <p>
        NewsFlash Hub aggregates headlines and snippets from external publishers
        using their publicly available RSS feeds. We do not write or edit the
        full articles. When you click a headline, you are taken to the original
        publisher’s website, where you should review the full context and verify
        all information before relying on it.
      </p>

      <h3>Financial, market and weather information</h3>
      <p>
        Any financial, market, cryptocurrency, commodity or weather information
        displayed on the Site is provided for general informational purposes only
        and should not be interpreted as investment, trading, financial or
        professional advice. Market data may be delayed or inaccurate. You should
        consult a qualified professional before making any financial or other
        important decisions.

        The Site is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not
        warrant that the Site will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure or free of
        harmful components, or that any defects will be corrected.
      </p>

      <h3>External links</h3>
      <p>
        Our Site contains links to external websites that are not operated by us.
        We have no control over the nature, content and availability of those
        sites. Inclusion of any links does not necessarily imply a recommendation

      <h3>Affiliates &amp; advertising</h3>
      <p>
        In the future, NewsFlash Hub may display advertisements or use affiliate
        links. This means we might earn a commission if you click or purchase
        through certain links, at no additional cost to you. Such relationships
        will not influence how we display headlines; however, you should always
        perform your own research before relying on any offer or promotion.
